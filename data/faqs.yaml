- Q: Why does my formula show incorrectly?
  A: |
    formula is made of mostly symbols, KSO does not carry the copyrighted fonts necessary to show these symbols,
    such as symbol, wingdings, webdings... You can get the fonts yourself <a href="/download/fonts">here</a>.
- Q: Missing fonts on startup?
  A: See above. ^_^
- Q: Does Kingsoft office plan to support odf?
  A: |
    We're sorry, but we just don't have the team to support odf. 
    <a href="http://wps-community.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=26&p=96">This post</a> has more information on that.
- Q: Do you have plans to provide 64-bit packages in the future?
  A: |
    Yes, we plan to provide x64 support. 
    However our code is ported from windows using the old COM style so it's hard to support x64. 
    We hope to have a x64-version by the end of the year. But a definite time is hard to predict. 
    <a href="http://wps-community.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=66">This post</a> is the last news about x64 version.
