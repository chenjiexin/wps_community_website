- Q: Why my formula show incorrectly?
  A: |
    Mostly, formula contains some symbol charactors, KSO does not carry some 
    copyright fonts that is necessary to show formula, such as symbol, wingdings, webdings...
    You can get there fonts <a href="/download/fonts/">here</a>.

    I'm sorry. We have no plan to support odf, recently.

- Q: Do you have any roadmap or plans to provide 64-bit packages in the future?
  A: |
    Yes, we have plan to provide x64 support.
    But our code is ported from windows, and using old com style.
    It's hard to support x64.
    We hope x64-version could run at the end of the year.
    But clear time is hard to expect.
    <a href="http://wps-community.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=66">This post</a> is the last news about x64 version.
