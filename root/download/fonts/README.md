About there fonts
================================================================================

There are some fonts needed by Kingsoft Office, but most of there fonts have 
copyright. So Kingsoft Office do not carry them directly. You get them here.

If you use Alpha 10 or earlier, you need all of them. If you use Alpha 11 or 
later, you do not need mtextra.ttf.

You can download them singly, or directly download 
[wps\_symbol\_fonts.zip](wps_symbol_fonts.zip).
